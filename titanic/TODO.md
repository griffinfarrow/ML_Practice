# What are the other things that we would like/could do?

* Bayesian optimisation using e.g. GPyOpt rather than Optuna
* Parallelise our optimisation problem 
* Extra feature engineering (e.g. using families)
* Optimisation of an xgboost model
* Cross-validation
* Plotting of our optimisation over time
